Replaced: This probably could work with more effort, but I switched to running Android Open Source project on Raspberry Pi, and then installing the DropOut app, instead.

An attempt at a plugin to launch DropOut.tv in Chromium, from Kodi media center.

You will need to remote into your Kodi Linux and run `setup.sh` from this repository, before this plugin can load.

Configure this plugin with `username` and `password` for your paid DropOut.tv account.
